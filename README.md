# End-to-End Text Summarizer Project 📃

This project aims to develop an end-to-end solution for text summarization, enabling the generation of concise summaries from textual data. The project leverages AWS services and follows a structured workflow to ensure efficient summarization of information.

## Workflows 🔄 

The following workflows are involved in the text summarizer project

1. 📝 Update `config.yaml`: Modify the configuration file (`config.yaml`) to customize settings based on specific project requirements.
2. 📝 Update `params.yaml`: Adjust the parameters file (`params.yaml`) to configure specific summarization parameters according to your needs.
3. 📝 Update entity: Modify the entity file to include relevant entities for the summarization process. 
4. 📝 Update the configuration manager in `src/config`: Make necessary updates to the configuration manager in the source code (`src/config`) to ensure proper integration of project components.
5. 📝 Update the components: Update individual components of the text summarizer, such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and summarization algorithms, as required.
6. 📝 Update the pipeline: Enhance the pipeline that orchestrates the flow of data through the summarization process.
7. 📝 Update `main.py`: Modify the main script file (`main.py`) to incorporate any changes or improvements to the overall functionality of the text summarizer.
8. 📝 Update `app.py`: Make necessary updates to the app script file (`app.py`), which is responsible for running the text summarizer as a web application.

AWS CI/CD Deployment with GitHub Actions ☁️🔧

This project includes AWS CI/CD deployment using GitHub Actions. The deployment process involves the following steps:

🔑 Login to AWS Console.
🧑‍💼 Create IAM User for Deployment:
✅ EC2 access: It is a virtual machine.
✅ ECR: Elastic Container Registry to save your Docker image in AWS.
Deployment Description 🚀

The deployment process can be summarized as follows:

🐳 Build a Docker image of the source code.
📤 Push your Docker image to ECR.
🚀 Launch your EC2 instance.
📥 Pull your image from ECR on EC2.
🏃‍♀️ Run your Docker image on EC2.
Policy 📜
Ensure that the following AWS policies are assigned:

AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
AmazonEC2FullAccess
Additional Steps for Deployment 🔄

Follow these additional steps to complete the deployment setup:

1. Create an ECR repository to store/save the Docker image.
Save the URI: 566373416292.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/text-s
1. Create an EC2 machine (Ubuntu).
3. Install Docker on the EC2 machine:
Optional:
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade

Required:

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker

4. Configure EC2 as a self-hosted runner:
Go to Settings > Actions > Runner > New self-hosted runner.
Choose the appropriate operating system.
Run the provided commands one by one.

5. Setup GitHub secrets:
Set the following secrets in your GitHub repository's settings:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION = us-east-1
AWS_ECR_LOGIN_URI = 566373416292.dkr.ecr.ap-south-

1.amazonaws.com
ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME = simple-app
